#  Smart Mutual Fund Recommendation System

## Overview

This project builds a machine learning-powered recommendation engine for mutual fund investments using historical NAV data from Indian markets (2006–2023). The system leverages time series analysis (ARIMA, LSTM) and user profiling to recommend top-performing funds aligned with the investor’s risk appetite and financial goals.

---

## Objectives

- Analyze NAV trends and volatility for various mutual fund schemes  
- Forecast fund growth using ARIMA and LSTM time series models  
- Recommend top mutual funds based on clustering and risk profiling  
- Deploy the system as a REST API for real-world usability  

---

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Indian Mutual Funds Dataset (2006–2023)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balajisr/indian-mutual-funds-dataset-20062023)  
- **Collected from**: Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI)  
- **Size**: ~29 million NAV records from over 35,000 schemes
